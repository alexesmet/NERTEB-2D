# NERTEB-2D
NERTEB is a **N**on **E**uclidian **R**ay **T**racing **E**ngine **B**eta - **2 D**imesional

### Idea
This engine calcualtes rays only for corners of the shapes, assuming there are straight lines between them. 
This allows to create a visual effect that player sees only what charcter from the game is able to see.
This, in turn, allows us to create optical illusions, putting player in a strange world.


### Technology stack
Engine is fully based ont [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) rust grapgic library. See [docummentation](https://docs.rs/ggez/0.5.1/ggez/) of this library
